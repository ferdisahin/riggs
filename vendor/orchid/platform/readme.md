## Introduction

Orchid is a free [Laravel](https://laravel.com) package that abstracts standard business logic and allows code-driven rapid application development of back office applications, admin/user panels and dashboards.

### Interesting Features

- **Rapid Application Development** - Focus to PHP development and don't lose time with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Build application logic, not admin panels. Try our [quick start guide](https://orchid.software/en/docs/quickstart/) and kick-start your application's development.

- **Form Builder** - Prevent reinventing the wheel or forms. Orchid supports already [40+ form elements](https://orchid.software/en/docs/field/) "out of the box" and allows you to build all kinds of forms quickly.

- **Fast Loading Times** - Enjoy a SPA like performance! Transitions can be made without reloading a page and require no additional code. Thanks to the [Hotwire](https://hotwire.dev/) project, Orchid makes this a satisfying experience for you and your users.

- **Access Permissions & Roles** - Take advantage of [granular access permissions](https://orchid.software/en/docs/access/), based on a user‚Äôs identity and corresponding role membership.

- **Filtering & Sorting** - Offer your users the ability to filter and sort data quickly! Orchid uses an [Eloquent based filtering/sorting approach](https://orchid.software/en/docs/quickstart-sort-filter-table/).

- **Fast Full-Text Search** - Take advantage of the integrated [Laravel Scout based full-text search](https://orchid.software/en/docs/global-search/), that allows searching through all available content, and displaying search results almost instantly.

- **Multiple Notifications Types** - Orchid offers [various types of notifications](https://orchid.software/en/docs/alert/) and allows your application to keep your users informed appropriately.

## Development

### Releasese Strategy

We like to keep things as modern as possible and have a "[release early, release often](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often)" approach to major releases. Meaning, we won't wait an arbitrary number of months to accumulate significant changes and release the next major version. By releasing major versions often, new features will be out earlier, and upgrading between versions will be much easier.

### Changelog

We actively and continuously maintain a [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) that informs about Orchid's history of improvements, bug fixes and changes.
